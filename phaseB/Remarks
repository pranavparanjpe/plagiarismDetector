Remarks:
UML:
1.	Core comparison object is missing. This is the reason you were asked for a high-level objective (AST comparator or comparison between isomorphic codes) in Phase A. It is still not clear how you are proceeding with the project 
2.	How are you getting the similarity percentage and report? It is not clear how you are comparing the files, you need to be more specific 
3.	You mentioned factory class in readme, I could not find the factory class in your UML, what objects are you creating using factory class.
4.	Not enough details for objects 
Interfaces:
1.	Note: No methods for core functionality.

Final Score: 83
