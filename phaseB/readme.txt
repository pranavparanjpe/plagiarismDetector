Phase B

The UML diagram provides an overview of our application design and relationships between some major components.

It shows the interactions between different operations (eg. compare, save) that can be performed on documents given as inputs, in the UI. It also has classes that represent validations that will be performed on an input provided in the application. Each class has its own parameters and methods.

Based on the UML diagram, we have mapped the corresponding Java interfaces and classes. We have also used the abstract factory design pattern to create objects of several classes.

The UML, Java classes and interfaces show a picture of how we vision our application to be developed but may lead to changes once we start implementation in Phase C.
